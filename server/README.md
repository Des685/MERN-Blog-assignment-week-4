A full-stack blog application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, featuring user authentication, post management, and a modern, responsive user interface.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a personal blog application designed to showcase the capabilities of the MERN stack. It allows users to register, log in, create, view, and manage blog posts. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, handling API requests and interacting with a MongoDB database. The frontend is a responsive single-page application developed with React, using Vite for a fast development experience and Tailwind CSS for styling.

**Current Status:** The project is in active development. Core functionalities like user authentication and basic post management are implemented.
